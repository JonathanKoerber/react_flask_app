In 2019 the media buy consisted of 2 spreads in O magazine,\n      digital ad page take over on Oprah.com, digital ads on Oprahmag.com, organic video placements on Oprah.com’s Facebook and\n      Instagram social channels and the shopping experience of Oprah’s Favorite Things on Amazon.com.

To make sure they captured everything\n        to properly execute these ads I got on a live call with the photographer on set and explained to him my concept\n        and discussed thoughts on what would be the best way to capture the shots. With his partnership, shots for digital\n        were done in two days. After retouch was completed and assets where masked in individual layers, I utilized Animate\n        CC to create motion graphics in multiple sizes. Depending on the size of the creative different assets we used. I included\n        a hover state for each graphic (where applicable) to tie in with our “sparkle” onsite creative."},

After asking several\n      times… weeks later we were told we could do video. We had no video content, Oh no! But there was no fear. We quickly\n      researched, concepted and consulted social experts and delivered 3 MP4s. 1 to be used on both Facebook and Instagram\n      and the other two were specific for each channel.
