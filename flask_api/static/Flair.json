I was making some pin\n      back buttons for a non-profit I volunteer and was considering going that route. Then I realized that pin-back buttons\n      are something that most everyone likes! My next thought was: Is there a convenient way for anyone to design and make\n      a button. Of course there is. – Web based services like Zazzle. I thought the idea was dead, until I did further research\n      and realized that all option were desktop web based. So now the challenge is to create an application that can be accessed\n      on a mobile device so users can create buttons on a whim. A key component of the design is to build-in restrictions to allow\n      the user to create a beautiful design without letting them feel limited by the process."
